This directory contains the scripts used to generate the Chameleon KVM and
bare-metal Ubuntu images. It relies on diskimage-builder.

The main script takes an output path as a unique (facultative) input parameter:
```
./create-image.sh <output_file>
```

and can be used as in the following example:
```
[cc@image-builder-jpastor Ubuntu]$ bash create-image.sh image_ubuntu.qcow2
trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img: OK
Building elements: base  chameleon-common vm

[...]

Converting image using qemu-img convert
Image file image_ubuntu.qcow2 created...
Image built in image_ubuntu.qcow2
to add the image in glance run the following command:
glance image-create --name "CC-Ubuntu14.04" --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --file image_ubuntu.qcow2
```

At the end of its execution, the script provides the Glance command that can be
used to upload the image to an existing OpenStack infrastructure.

The other scripts in the `elements` directory are invoked by create-image.sh.
This script does the following:

* Download an Ubuntu cloud image from upstream
* Customize it for Chameleon (see `elements` directory for details)
* Generate an image compatible with OpenStack KVM and bare-metal

The image must then be uploaded and registered with Glance (currently done
manually, by running the Glance command given at the end of execution).
